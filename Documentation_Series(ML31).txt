Init signature: pd.Series(data=None, index=None, dtype=None, name=None, copy=False, fastpath=False)
Docstring:     
One-dimensional ndarray with axis labels (including time series).

Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. The object
supports both integer- and label-based indexing and provides a host of
methods for performing operations involving the index. Statistical
methods from ndarray have been overridden to automatically exclude
missing data (currently represented as NaN).

Operations between Series (+, -, /, *, **) align values based on their
associated index values-- they need not be the same length. The result
index will be the sorted union of the two indexes.

Parameters
----------
data : array-like, dict, or scalar value
    Contains data stored in Series
index : array-like or Index (1d)
    Values must be hashable and have the same length as `data`.
    Non-unique index values are allowed. Will default to
    RangeIndex(len(data)) if not provided. If both a dict and index
    sequence are used, the index will override the keys found in the
    dict.
dtype : numpy.dtype or None
    If None, dtype will be inferred
copy : boolean, default False
    Copy input data
